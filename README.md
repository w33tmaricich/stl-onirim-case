# onirim-insert

OpenSCAD source code for an insert for the card game Onirim. Once you sleeve
the game, the cards no longer fit in the box. This is a simple insert that
allows for it to be stored in its original packaging again.

## Usage

The compiled stl should be in the current directory. Open with `openscad` if you
want to make modifications yourself.

## Designs

### V1

This version holds the entire set of sleeved cards as well as deviders to
seperate them. The cards lay on their side, so you will need a rubber band to
hold the lid closed. There is a location that holds the incubus.

### Cross

The cross stl is a debugging tool for me to make sure they will press up firmly
against the sides of the box.
